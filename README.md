this character is now fighting fucking Santa

Give the player the freedom to draw themselves on the Game. What about
collisions?

Developer rules:
  - The attacks and defends must be unnecessarily specific. No generic objects
    or references. Paint a picture.


# Characters
## Benjamin

## DeAnne

## Jana

## Josh
- Faraday Cage: Defends against EM waves and recuperates. "Joshua will live 10
  years longer than any other family member. But for now, he just kinda looks
  crazy".

## Logan
- Breakdance Tornado: Plays Safety Dance hook and shoots out toxic semen.
- Silent Treatment: Logan goes invisible and he can not attack or be
  attacked. Slowly regenerates health.
- Emotional Destruction: 25% chance logan's words get to santa and santa commits
  suicide. Show the actual words that Logan says to Santa. Otherwise, santa ...

## Lucas
- Lube Up: Covers himself in a layer of glaze. Evasion goes up.

## Nicholas
- You See, The Oil Markets ...: Says some shit about the economy that doesn't
  make sense.
- Something related to Elon Musk

## Robert
- HUH: makes a deafening noise of confusion, because he didn't hear what you just
  said. But in reality, he did hear you and was only stalling to build up power
  for his next move

## Santa
Drunken, dickhead Santa Claus.
TODO: Method acting to get his quotes.

TODO: give to each other player, have it diminish their attacks and defends on a scale
of 1% to 100% according to their drunkeness given by Santa

Everything Santa says is drunk text. Make the drunkenness random (Drunkness Translator, written by Ben)
Drunkenly steps when he tries to move (just a slightly random force pushing him in random directions)

- Questionable Gift: "it doesn't quite look right, but he says it was on your
  Christmas list" targeted to each player. 50% chance of being a gift that
  person genuinely wants and increases their stamina, health, or whatever. 25%
  chance of whiskey. 20%, it's like a bomb, poison, or some shit. 4% coal. 1%
  it's vomit.
- Big Sip: "Santa take big sip" and becomes more accepting and relaxed to
  impact. Attacks are diminished by 20%. "That all you got, pussy?"
- Elf Rain: Multiple simple elves travel from top to bottom of screen and you
  must dodge them. 1 hit does 20% damage
- Hitman: Large Will-Ferrell-esque bot chases you for 15 seconds. Each hit does
  10% damage. While chasing you, says will ferrell quotes from Elf. TODO: Can we
  use actual audio from Elf?
