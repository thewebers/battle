    - Effect: -4 health on impact
- Absorbs all your moves in his butt-chin.
    - ...

## DeAnne

- ROCK TIME: Drops a rock somewhere on her side of the map, and it deflects attacks.
- The Gift of Life: Attempts to create a girl, with 10% she has a girl named Lane, but with 90% she makes another testosterone-filled boy Donald that doesn't seem to appreciate her generous contributions and services - sucks the life out of her on every turn.

  A week passes and you've lost health due to starvation.

  years longer than any other family member. But for now, he just kinda looks
  crazy".
- THE HOLLYWOOD: Josh turns into Santa, and any damage done onto Josh is done to Santa.

## Logan

## Lucas
- Lube Up: Covers himself in a layer of glaze. Evasion goes up.
- That one vein in his right arm gains control over his consciousness

  said. But in reality, he did hear you and was only stalling to build up power
  for his next move
- Hay bale toss while playing "The Devil Went Down to Georgia"

## Santa
Drunken, dickhead Santa Claus.

TODO: give to each other player, have it diminish their attacks and defends on a scale
of 1% to 100% according to their drunkeness given by Santa

Everything Santa says is drunk text. Make the drunkenness random (Drunkness Translator, written by Ben)
Drunkenly steps when he tries to move (just a slightly random force pushing him in random directions)

- Questionable Gift: "it doesn't quite look right, but he says it was defintely on your
  Christmas list" targeted to each player. 50% chance of being a gift that
  person genuinely wants and increases their stamina, health, or whatever. 25%
  chance of whiskey. 20%, it's like a bomb, poison, or some shit. 4% coal. 1%
  it's vomit.
- Big Sip: "Santa take big sip" and becomes more accepting and relaxed to
  impact. Attacks are diminished by 20%. "That all you got, pussy?"
- Elf Rain: Multiple simple elves travel from top to bottom of screen and you
  must dodge them. 1 hit does 20% damage
- Hitman: Large Will-Ferrell-esque bot chases you for 15 seconds. Each hit does
  10% damage. While chasing you, says will ferrell quotes from Elf. TODO: Can we
  use actual audio from Elf?
- Calls you a r*tared n*gger
