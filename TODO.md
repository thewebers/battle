# Queue that's Actually Being Done
- Add turn-based gameplay.
  - Figure out dialog behavior.
    - We want arbitrary progression conditions between different dialog frames.

      - End of timer after showing the begin-turn quote
      - Pressing a button to select a move
      - Finishing the selected move (e.g., running out of projectiles to throw)
  - Limit the number of projectiles that can be thrown on a turn.
- Collide projectiles with players.
- Bounce projectiles off walls.
